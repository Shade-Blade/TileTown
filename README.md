# TileTown
A prototype for a tile based puzzle game. Created in 2020 and mostly abandoned.

The main idea is trying to place tiles in a grid with some restrictions for when a tile gives you points depending on the type of the tile.

I stopped developing this because I wasn't sure what to do next and I was running out of ideas for tile types that aren't too complex. Also, puzzle solving wasn't as interesting as I thought.

This was based on an old school project from 2019.
